            <p class="text-project">This is my first full-time job as a junior front end developer. My role was to add new features and functionalities to a  <span style="color:#f9bd23; font-weight:bold">SAAS application</span> written in <span style="color: #e23337;; font-weight:bold">Angular</span>. I occasionally worked on the back end of the project, written in <span style="color: #67217a;; font-weight:bold">C#</span>. Working with a <strong>large team</strong> of highly skilled developers has allowed me to rapidly expand my <strong> coding competencies</strong> and <strong>level of autonomy</strong> . My boss in particular has been a wonderful mentor to me in helping me expand my coding knowledge. We work using the <span style="color:#F46B3F; font-weight:bold">Agile methodology</span>.</p>
              <p class="text-project">The opportunity to build features starting from an API route on the backend and taking it all the way to <span style="color: #e23337;; font-weight:bold">Angular</span> templates on the frontend has been
              both a pleasure and a rewarding experience. Working on a <strong>mature code base</strong>  has really accelerated my learning curve, and I’ve been amazed at how fast my <strong>competencies</strong> and <strong>autonomy</strong> have evolved, particularly with <span style="color: #e23337;; font-weight:bold">Angular</span>.</p>
      
            <p class ="text-project">We would do a <strong>scrum</strong> on a daily basis and after my boss had presented the tasks of the sprint every 2 weeks I would go and work (mostly) <span style="color:f37a8f; font-weight:bold">autonomous </span>on each of my task. I make sure I have follow every leads I read the  <span style="color:2196f3; font-weight:bold">documentation</span> and would do an <span style="color:#f9bd23; font-weight:bold">online tutorial</span> if need be before I ask for assistance. I strongly believe that I remember better something that I would have figure it out on my own. Of course I don't hesitate to ask for assistance when I feel I won't come up with a solution myself.</p> 
            <p class ="text-project">Working with <span style="color: #e23337;; font-weight:bold">Angular</span> and <span style="color: #67217a;; font-weight:bold">C#</span> on a daily basis, I have a stronger understanding of OOP (Object Oriented Programing). We used  <span style="color: #fa7035;; font-weight:bold">GitLab</span> as a version control system and <span style="color:5daef7; font-weight:bold">YouTrack by JetBrains</span> as an agile board to support the scrum.</p>  
            
            <p class="text-project">With the Covid-19 epidemic I’ve been working <span style="color:f37a8f; font-weight:bold">completely remotely </span>with the team. In spite of only working at a distance, I’ve been excited to find just how much I can <strong>contribute to the code base</strong>  and advance in my own learnings even from afar, both in a coding sense and also in understanding the <strong>complex core business</strong>. Though credit must also go to the whole tech team who has been incredibly welcoming and supportive.</p>
