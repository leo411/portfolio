      <p class="text-project">This is my first ever coding project.
        I decided to host the site on <strong>Github</strong> due to it’s popularity, I also decided to use <span style="color:#0066B8; font-weight:bold">Visual Studio Code</span> due to it’s popularity (I’ve been using these ever since). Using git has been an adventure, and even though this is a personal project with only one developer (me!) I try to use good git practices just to make sure that I’m getting into good habits.
        I prefer to learn by doing and this project helped me to fully grasp the foundations of <span style="color:#F46B3F; font-weight:bold">HTML</span> and <span style="color: #1744dc; font-weight:bold">CSS</span>. 
        Thanks to this project I’ve learnt the basics of how to display my first HTML page.
        <span style="color: #7952b3; font-weight:bold">Bootstrap</span> helped me to build quickly and with good CSS practices (it’s been great for learning). I’ve used their <span style="color:#61A840; font-weight:bold">jumbotron, navbar and carousel components</span>,  which I often go back to for inspiration in my other projects.
        I had a lot of fun putting together the styles and theming for the website, particularly the font selection. Other fun parts of the site are the <span style="color:#f9bd23; font-weight:bold">onHover CSS transitions</span>  for the gallery images, as well as a fun “masonry” package that I used to jigsaw together images on the “ambiance” page. This also used a little bit of JavaScript that tracks the users scroll positions and only shows images to them once they can be visible on the page; it does this with a simple fade in animation once the class changes.</p>

      <p class="text-project">I really enjoyed building this website because there a solution for everything you want to build or you’re being asked to build and I found it very intellectually challenging to learn <span style="color:#F46B3F; font-weight:bold">all the new techniques and technology</span> that I’ve leveraged.
        I had several meetings with the interior designer to come up with the look and feel of the site, which was a <span style="color:#E10098; font-weight:bold">lot of fun</span>.
        I built this site in my spare time whilst holding down a full-time job. It was difficult for me to juggle both at the same time because I wanted to spend more time working on the site than I did at my marketing job! It was around this time when I started to consider that web development might be a possible <span style="color:#8a4baf; font-weight:bold">career path for me</span>.</p>
