      <p style="line-height:1.9">This website has been the first project I worked on. It helped me fully graps the foundation of HTML and CSS. I've used the front-end component library, Bootsrap to help me with the css. The interior designer needed a website to showcase her previous work, the atmosphere she likes to display, the pricing and contact details. From a UI/UX perspective I wanted the user to be able to grasp everything the interior designer can offer from the homepage. The user can easily understand what her previous work looks like thanks to the carrousel and the 3 pictures below it which are linked to the "réalisations/work" pages. The user can also jumped to the contact page thanks to the button at the end of the page. I also wanted the website to have a strong "company-image" so I made a jumbotron. </p>

      <p style="line-height:1.9">I only present the last work the interior designer made not to overwhelmed the user. The user can access it either through the navbar toggler or directly from the picture on the home page. The page atmosphere allow the user to understant the type of atmosphere the interior designer like to display. There of course a pricing page and finally a contact page. I very much enjoyed working on this project always try to put me in the shoes of the user and try to display accordingly is very challenging.</p>
