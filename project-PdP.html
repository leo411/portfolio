      <p class="text-project">This blog that I built for an instagramming pharmacist is my second project (it’s a bit of a WIP, but I’m getting there!)

        I’ve chosen to build it in <span style="color:#8a4baf; font-weight:bold">GatsbyJS</span> due to Gastby’s popularity with bloggers, and the fact that I would get to put all the hours of React training that I’ve put in at <span style="color:#F46B3F; font-weight:bold">Codecademy </span>into practice. To start things off, I read through the Gatsby documentation and did a few of their step by step tutorials which helped me build a basic site with their starter template. Once I completed the tutorials I went and picked out a more complete template from Gastby’s selection with a design I thought would go well for my project.
        I spent a few days trying to figure out how the site was built and it turned out to be quite complicated; the starter documentation is pretty good for Gatsby, but once you start using their plugins it turns into magic, and the documentation disappears. This made it really tricky to fix bugs and customize the blog the way the client wanted it.
        After doing some pair-programming with my partner (he’s a web developer), we found that the plugins and some of the integrations with Netlify had had some bugs in them from the very start (this was my first real experience trying to debug someone else’s code!) After a number of hours trying to correct things (only to find more bugs) we decided that it would be best to start the blog from a very basic template, and only add plugins as they were necessary for the functionality that we required.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="text-project">Since then, things have been far more straightforward, and I’ve managed to get something close to a working blog within a week.
        It’s been great fun to work with <span style="color:#5393fe; font-weight:bold">React and JSX</span>, and to see all the benefits (and much prettier code) that I can get compared to my first project which was written in vanilla HTML and CSS.  <span style="color:#f9bd23; font-weight:bold">Components</span> have been a huge timesaver, re-using code is the best!
        The Gatsby data layer is powered with <span style="color:#E10098; font-weight:bold">GraphQL</span>, which was another new technology for me. It was interesting to see the flow of uploading a new blog through <span style="color: #008a7e; font-weight:bold">Netlify</span>, and then having that blog be pulled into my components using GraphQL. It was a little tricky to understand what was going on at first (the GraphQL docs helped), but I feel like I have a better grip on the ideas now (even if the <span style="color: #7952b3; font-weight:bold">Gatsby plugins</span> do most of the heavy lifting for me). It’s a technology I’m looking forward to using and better understanding in the future.</p>

    <p class="text-project">After working on this project (even though it has only been a short time) I feel vindicated in my decision <span style="color: #7952b3; font-weight:bold">to quit my job and try to switch careers</span>; I wake up every morning looking forward to working on my code, and <span style="color:#F46B3F; font-weight:bold">I love the creativity</span>, and that feeling I get when things work!</p>
