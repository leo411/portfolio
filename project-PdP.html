      <p style="line-height:1.9">This website is a blog that has been build with GatsbyJS for a pharmacist. It is today mainly a blog but later during the year the pharmacist would like to organise nutrition workshops so I prepare a page to host this activity. She also wants an ecommerce interface to be able to sell her boxes either through subscription or depending on topics (beauty, nutrition, health). Gatsby leverages the power of React and it was very interesting for me to work with this library.</p>

      <p style="line-height:1.9">My customer already has a blog running on Instagram with thousands of people following her advices on health, nutrition and beauty. She releases posts about the latest news about those 3 topics. The website needed match the look and feel of the instagram account. The user need to be able to have all the posts "advices" or "news" but also all the posts "beauty", "nutrition", "health". Thanks to Gatsby JS and GraphQL I was able to query for those categories and subcategories. The pharmacist wanted the website to link to her instagram so I add it in the footer. She will also refer to the website from her Instagram.</p>

    <p style="line-height:1.9">The pharmacist is going to use Netlify as a content manager system. It is very user friendly. She is very happy with the interface. This project is host on Github and deploy on Netlify.</p>
